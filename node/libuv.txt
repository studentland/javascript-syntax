The "libuv" is a C library originally written for Node.js
to abstract non-blocking I/O operations.

https://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/api.html

Also has mechanisms to handle services like
File System, DNS, network, child processes, pipes,
signal handling, polling, and streaming.
To perform blocking operations that
canâ€™t be done asynchronously at OS level,
libuv also includes a thread pool to distribute CPU loads.

Libuv uses 4 threads by default, but can be changed
process.env.UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE = 5;

Features of libuv:
- Full-featured event loop backed by
epoll (Linux), kqueue (OSX), IOCP (Windows), event ports (SunOS).
- Asynchronous TCP (net module) and UDP (dgram module)
- Asynchronous DNS resolution (used partly for the dns module)
- Asynchronous file, file system operations & events (fs module)
- ANSI escape code controlled TTY
- Thread pool and Signal handling
- Child processes
- High-resolution clock
- Threading and synchronization primitives.
- Inter-Process Communication using
sockets and Unix domain sockets (Windows)

Benefits:
- Disk operations are performed asynchronously.
- High level operations can be broken down to
simpler disk operations which facilitate rectifying the information.
- Disk thread can use vector operations like
readv & writev allowing more buffers to be passed.
